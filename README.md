## Introduction to C Programming
### 2019-2020 - Spring Term

## Prerequisities

 - Curiosity about programming and algorithms.
 - Knowledge of at least one programming language.
 - Attendees must prepare their own programming environment

## Goal

Participants will learn to solve the problems that we encounter in daily life or writing efficient code starting from the basic algorithm information. Competitive Programming will be introduced and we will have the opportunity to apply our knowledge after adapting what we have learned to the question types with the competitions that will be hold every week.
